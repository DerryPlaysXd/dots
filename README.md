# Information!
Hi! This is my set up of Awesome Window Manager. Including all the packages I use daily.

## Packages
Script includes (more to be added for full out of the box experience):
```
awesome
polybar
alacritty
Brave browser
git
virt-manager and all it's dependencies
steam
discord
```

## Dislaimer
At the moment the script is not full. Awesome might not launch if you don't have the correct drivers installed and the script currently also doesn't install xorg, x11 or anything else.

For customization at the moment please comment out all the software you don't need or want *remember to comment out the lines about config aswell. You can skip it, but it will leave you with useless config files for software you don't have installed.*

## Installation
You will need GIT:
```
sudo pacman -Sy git
```

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/derryplaysxd/dots
```

cd into the directory
```
cd dots/
```

Add execution rights to the script
```
chmod +x install.sh
```

```
./install.sh
```
Everything should happen automatically.
