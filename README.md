# Information!

Hi! This is my set up of Awesome Window Manager.


## Installation
You will need GIT:
```
sudo pacman -Sy git
```

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/derryplaysxd/dots
```

cd into the directory
```
cd dots/
```

Add execution rights to the script
```
chmod +x install.sh
```

Everything should happen automatically.
