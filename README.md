# Information!
Hi! This is my set up of Awesome Window Manager.

## Dislaimer
At the moment the script is not full. Awesome might not launch if you don't have the correct drivers installed and the script currently also doesn't install xorg, x11 or anything else.

## Installation
You will need GIT:
```
sudo pacman -Sy git
```

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/derryplaysxd/dots
```

cd into the directory
```
cd dots/
```

Add execution rights to the script
```
chmod +x install.sh
```

Everything should happen automatically.
